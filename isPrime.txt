A prime number is a number that is only evenly divisible by itself and 1. For example, the number 5 is prime because it can only be evenly divided by 1 and 5. The number 6, however, is not prime because it can be divided evenly by 1, 2, 3, and 6.
Design a Boolean function named isPrime, which takes an integer as an argument and returns True if the argument is a prime number, or False otherwise. Use the function in a program that prompts the user to enter a number and then displays a message indicating whether the number is prime.

Function isPrime( Integer n):
    If n < 1:
        Return False
    Else if n == 1:
        Return True

    For i from 2 to square root(n):
        If n % i == 0:
            Return False
    Return True

Module Main:
    Display "Enter an integer:"
    Input number
    If isPrime(number):
        Display "number is a prime number."
    Else:
        Display "number is not a prime number."
