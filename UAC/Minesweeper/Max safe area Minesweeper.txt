Max Safe Area in Minesweeper
Given a board of size n x n.
Given m mines in the board.
Find the maximum safe area in the board.

Format Input:
The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 0 ≤ m ≤ n^2).
The next m lines contain two integers x and y (0 ≤ x, y < n) which represent the position of the mines.

Format Output:
The output contains n lines, each line containing n characters. The board only contains '.', '*', and digits from '1' to '8'. The character is either '.' or a digit from '1' to '8', representing the number of mines around the cell. The character '*' represents a mine.
The last line contains the maximum safe area.
